# DSP_lib_common

This is a DSP C++ library with some helper scripts in Python for data visulization.

It works with WAV format and requires libsndfile which you can get from http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/ or https://github.com/erikd/libsndfile

Compile it with CMake and use it as .so and also check these files:

dsp_lookup.py - to check file sample rate and samples count

dsp_filters.py - to apply library filters to a file

dsp_graphs.py - to visualize data
